## Project Description

This is a marked up letter for hosting on university intranet. The letter is written as a response to a PhD application, and is an example demonstrating the appropriate use of HTML document structure for both block and inline semantics. The letter was provided as content in text format and is available here:
- [letter plaintext](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/marking-up-a-letter-start/letter-text.txt)
with the corresponding css available here:
- [css file](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/marking-up-a-letter-start/css.txt)

For a full description of the project requirements, see [Introduction to HTML: Marking up a Latter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter).

This html file was run through a [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for validation.

## Running the Website

1. To run everything you will need to Fork or Clone this repository and open in up in an IDE on your local PC or in VS Codespaces.

2. Once you have cloned the Repo, open it up in VS Code.

3. Select the index.html file from the Explorer Window.

4. Then, using the VS Code Command Palette, type: > Live Preview Start Server. If this command is not available, you may need to install the VS Code Live Preview extension.

5. This will open up a website preview within your IDE. You can also open this in an external browser if you choose, by clicking on the 3 horizontal lines icon to the top right of the preview window and selecting 'Open in Browser'.

## Reflection

I need more HTML practice! I learned I have the basics down well, but I struggled a bit with the subscripts, superscripts, the abbreviation & expansion, and the definition list types (never used this!). Thankfully I browsed all the documentation provided in the Module's README.md which provided a lot of these with examples, so it was pretty easy to piece together. I do know without that, I would have had to Google, A LOT. So while I'm glad I understand or believe I understand the basic semantics and structure of HTML, there is obviously a lot more out there to learn/understand.
