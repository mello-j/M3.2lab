### Project Description

This is a project for CS 408 Full Stack Web Development. This is meant to be an introductory lab to dust off the cobwebs from CS 208, working through a light sample of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and using the IDE and other associated tools to run the lab.

My Project is relatively basic but meets the functional requirements  as noted in Task 6 in the Lab Guide. I added a non-functional nav-bar for now (if you want to be rick-rolled, feel free to click on one of the links). I also added a link to my Github page from CS 208 that I added a few cool things too. That's pretty much it! For detailed descriptions on how to run/navigate the webpage, see the "Run the Site" section.

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other

source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.
